Part 1 - C# Tutorial

In this session

1. We will learn the basic structure of a c# program. The program we used in this video is shown below.

// Namespace Declaration

using System;

class Pragim
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        // Write to console
        Console.WriteLine ("Welcome Vikas, Ready for study👍!"); 
    }
}



2. Understand the purpose of using System declaration - The namespace declaration, using System, indicates that you are using the System namespace. If  you omit the using System, declaration, then you have to use the fully qualified name of the Console class. A namespace is used to organize your code and is collection of classes, interfaces, structs, enums and delegates. We will discuss about namespaces in detail in a later session.

3. Purpose of Main() method - Main method is the entry point into your application.
